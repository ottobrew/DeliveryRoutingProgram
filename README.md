# DeliveryRoutingProgram

This is a Delivery Routing Program written in Python 3 using PyCharm 2022.2.2 (Community Edition) IDE.  

A project for Algorithms & Data Structures II course, this program utilizes a hash table and greedy algorithm to efficiently route
40 packages for delivery by two trucks in fewer than 140 miles, while meeting detailed requirements for truck space limits, 
individual package delays, delivery deadlines, and one address change. CLI allows user to track packages by package id and check delivery status of packages by entering a time.
